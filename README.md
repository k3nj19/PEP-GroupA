# PEP-GroupA
Hong Kong Enhancement Program for Gifted Students in Physics

Group A is designed towards students who
- Have a strong interest and curiosity in Physics.
- Are confident with your Math skills. (Expect to have studied calculus)
- Want to study university level subjects earlier.
- Aim to compete in the upcoming international olympiads as one of the HK team members.

Group A can be conducted in Cantonese if everybody understands Cantonese. However the notes will still be written in English.

# Syllabus & Schedule

## Pre-requisite 

Most of the topics in mechanics will not be focused since they are already in the syllabus of the Hong Kong Physics Olympiad Competition (HKPhO).
- Constant acceleration motion, projectile
- Force, torque, center of mass
- Energy
- Momentum
- Circular motion, gravitation
- Simple Harmonic Motion
- Static fluid mechanics

They shall be reviewed through practices, if time allows.
